\section{Mixing in the Wild}
\label{sec:mixing-wild}

This section motivates the development of a mixed graph-based scheduler that minimizes unneccessary aborts
by surveying the isolation levels supported by commercial and open source DBMSs.

It is rare for practical DBMSs to offer applications only a singular isolation level, instead permitting
transactions to be run at different isolation levels. In order to assess this claim we surveyed the 
isolation levels offered by 24 DBMSs in~\Cref{tab:survey}\footnote{
\df~Indicates the default setting,
$^{\mathrm{a}}$~Referred to as \level{Read Stability},
$^{\mathrm{b}}$~Behaves like \level{Read Committed} due to MVCC implementation,
$^{\mathrm{c}}$~Implemented as \level{Snapshot Isolation},
$^{\mathrm{d}}$~Requires manual lock management,
$^{\mathrm{e}}$~Behaves like \level{Consistent Read}.}. Classification was performed 
based on each database's public documentation. We found 7 isolation levels represented:
\level{Read Uncommitted}, \level{Read Committed}, \level{Cursor Stability}, \level{Snapshot Isolation}, 
\level{Consistent Read}, \level{Repeatable Read}, and \level{Serializable}. Note, the exact behavior of each 
isolation level is highly system-dependent. Interestingly, we found 18 databases supported multiple isolation
levels. Of systems offering a singular isolation level \level{Serializable} was the most common; these systems 
were typically NewSQL~\cite{DBLP:journals/sigmod/PavloA16} systems, e.g., 
CockroachDB~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/TaftSMVLGNWBPBR20}. This may suggest a trend away 
from mixed DBMSs, however, TiDB recently added support for \level{Consistent Read} isolation~\cite{tidb} 
indicating the utility of weaker isolation in practical systems remains.
% The prevalence of mixed DBMSs supports 
% the development of a highly performant mixed concurrency control protocol that minimizes unnecessary aborts.
